# React, Webpack Boilerplate

Boilerplate designed to get up and running on a new React project in no time.
The boilerplate includes ES2015 JS transpiler (Babel), Web Dev Server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), ES2015 linter ([Airbnb]( https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb))
and Sass compiler.

Once you have downloaded/cloned the repo, run:

    $ npm install

The following commands are then available:

    $ npm run build
    $ npm run dev

"build" - compiles (and minifies) the React app in the /build/ folder ready for deployment.

"dev" - starts up the dev server (http://localhost:3000) with HMR.

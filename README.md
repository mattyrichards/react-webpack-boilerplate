# React, Webpack Boilerplate

Boilerplate designed to get up and running on a new React project in no time.
The boilerplate includes ES2015 JS transpiler (Babel), Web Dev Server (with Hot Module Replacement)
and Sass compiler.

Once you have downloaded/cloned the repo, run:

    $ npm install

The following commands are then available:

    $ npm run build-app
    $ npm run dev-server
    $ npm run build-css
    $ npm run watch-css

"build-app" - compiles the React app.
"dev-server" - starts up the dev server (http://localhost:3000).
"build-css" - compiles the Sass files.
"watch-css" - watches the Sass files and compiles when they are modified.

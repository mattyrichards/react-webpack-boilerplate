# React, Webpack Boilerplate

Boilerplate designed to get up and running on a new React project in no time.
The boilerplate includes ES2015 JS transpiler (Babel), Web Dev Server (with Hot Module Replacement)
and Sass compiler.

Once you have downloaded/cloned the repo, run:

    $ npm install

The following commands are then available:

    $ npm build-app
    $ npm server
    $ npm build-css
    $ npm watch-css

"build-app" - compiles the React app.
"server" - starts up the server (http://localhost:3000).
"build-css" - compiles the Sass files.
"watch-css" - watches the Sass files and compiles when they are modified.
